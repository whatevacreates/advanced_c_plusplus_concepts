Forbidden functions : None
Implement a Weapon class that has:

• A private attribute type, which is a string.
• A getType() member function that returns a const reference to type.
• A setType() member function that sets type using the new one passed as param-
eter.


Now, create two classes: HumanA and HumanB. They both have a Weapon and a
name. They also have a member function attack() that displays (of course, without the
angle brackets):
<name> attacks with their <weapon type>
HumanA and HumanB are almost the same except for these two tiny details:
• While HumanA takes the Weapon in its constructor, HumanB doesn’t.
• HumanB may not always have a Weapon, whereas HumanA will always be armed.

C++ - Module 01
Memory allocation, pointers to members,
references, switch statement
If your implementation is correct, executing the following code will print an attack
with "crude spiked club" then a second attack with "some other type of club" for both
test cases:
int main()
{
{
Weapon club = Weapon("crude spiked club");
HumanA bob("Bob", club);
bob.attack();
club.setType("some other type of club");
bob.attack();
}
{
Weapon club = Weapon("crude spiked club");
HumanB jim("Jim");
jim.setWeapon(club);
jim.attack();
club.setType("some other type of club");
jim.attack();
}
return 0;
}
Don’t forget to check for memory leaks.
In which case do you think it would be best to use a pointer to
Weapon? And a reference to Weapon? Why? Think about it before
starting this exercise
