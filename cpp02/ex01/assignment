The previous exercise was a good start but our class is pretty useless. It can only
represent the value 0.0.
Add the following public constructors and public member functions to your class:
• A constructor that takes a constant integer as a parameter.
It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value is
initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.
• A constructor that takes a constant floating-point number as a parameter.
It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value is
initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.
• A member function float toFloat( void ) const;
that converts the fixed-point value to a floating-point value.
• A member function int toInt( void ) const;
that converts the fixed-point value to an integer value.
And add the following function to the Fixed class files:
• An overload of the insertion («) operator that inserts a floating-point representation
of the fixed-point number into the output stream object passed as parameter
that sets the raw value of the fixed-point number.
